# docker-armhf-motion

Set of scripts used to create a size optmized Docker image for the [Motion software package](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) for the ARM v7 architecture - specifically it has been tested on a [Odroid U3 board](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=g138745696275). The source code is taken from [this unofficial repository] (https://github.com/Mr-Dave/motion) on github.
The build is done inside a container and the resulting image is about 49MB in terms of size.
